How to run program:
    When started, the program will ask the user for input in the form of a string.
The program will then begin encrypting the text and hiding it across a wav file. Next,
the program goes back through the wav file to recover the data that was hidden within it.
That data is then decrypted and placed in a text file for the user to open and read.

Future work:
    Additional audio file types could be added to give more diverse outcomes. More advanced
security could also be added to the program. An example of this could be accessing the webcam
of the user's computer and taking a picture to determine the number of people viewing the screen.
Using facial recognition, the program could refuse to remove hidden data if the number of faces
exceeds a given number.
